# Diabetes Classification and Analysis Program
This program employs machine learning to classify diabetes status based on features like glucose levels, insulin, BMI, and age from a dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training using K-Nearest Neighbors, visualization of decision boundaries, user input validation, and evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score.

Long Description:
The Diabetes Classification and Analysis program utilizes supervised machine learning techniques to predict diabetes status based on health metrics derived from the diabetes dataset. It begins by prompting users to select pairs of health parameters (such as glucose and blood pressure) for comparison. After preprocessing the data and splitting it into training and testing sets, the program scales the features using StandardScaler and trains a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.

Key functionalities include visualizing decision boundaries with mlxtend, validating user inputs within the dataset's range, and displaying a confusion matrix to evaluate classification performance. It calculates and presents metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score to assess model effectiveness. The program also predicts diabetes likelihood based on user-provided health metrics, displaying results graphically and quantitatively.

Designed for both educational and practical purposes, this program offers insights into applying machine learning to healthcare data, aiding in diabetes risk assessment and contributing to broader research on predictive analytics in medicine.
