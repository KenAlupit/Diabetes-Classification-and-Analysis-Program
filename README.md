# Diabetes-Classification-and-Analysis-Program
This program employs machine learning to classify diabetes status based on features like glucose levels, insulin, BMI, and age from a dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training using K-Nearest Neighbors, visualization of decision boundaries, user input validation, and evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score.
